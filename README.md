# RockbusterSQL
This project focused on the company Rockbuster, which is a fictional movie rental company that used to have stores around the world.  They are facing stiff competition from streaming services and the management team wants to use their existing movie licenses to launch their own online video rental service to stay competitive.  
## Objective
The primary objective was to help with the launch strategy for the new online service.  The dataset provided contained information about the existing clients in the form of a relational database.  

The information included locations of the clients, names, and how much they spent on movie rentals.  The data set also contained revenue
information about individual movies and their respective genres.  

The source of the data was provided to me from Rockbuster.  Visualizations were created using Excel and Tableau.
