# RockbusterSQL
This project focused on the company Rockbuster, which is a fictional movie rental company that used to have stores around the world.  
## Objective
The primary objective was to help with the launch strategy for the new online service.  The dataset provided contained information about the existing clients in the form of a relational database.  They are facing stiff competition from streaming services and the management team wants to use their existing movie licenses to launch their own online video rental service to stay competitive.  
## Data
The information was provided by a set of tables containing data:
### Fact Tables
- Payment
- Rental
### Dimension Tables
- Actor
- Address
- Category
- City
- Country
- Customer
- Film
- Film Actor

## Sources & Visualizations
